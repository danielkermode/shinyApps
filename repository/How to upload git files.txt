this is for my reference.

git init
(initialises at directory of git)

git add [file or folder name which also has to be in the directory of git]

git commit -m "commit" 

(commit tracked changes, not too sure exactly what this does but "commit" comes up as a name beside the uploaded files.)

git remote add origin [url]

(sets repository url to github repository url, if it is the same repository as used previously you'll get an error but it's fine.)

git remote -v
(verifies remote URL)

git push origin master
(uploads the new local repository to the repository on github, and does any changes on the files in github.
may have to use "git pull" to get files from github if there are files that don't exist in the local repository but 
exist on github.)
