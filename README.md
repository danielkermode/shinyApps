# shinyApps
shiny Apps created for NZAM

This is a shiny app which generates "matrix and composite scores", a ranking metric used by fund of funds company NZAM, from a set of monthly return data.

Uploaded just so I could practice using github, the app will not be of much interest to anyone outside NZAM. It uses R code to calculate different matrices for a csv file inputted, then weights the matrices accordingly to generate scores.
