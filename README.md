# shinyApps
shiny Apps created for NZAM

The first two R files are code for a shiny app which generates "matrix and composite scores", a ranking metric used by fund of funds company NZAM, from a set of monthly return data (chosen by user).

Uploaded just so I could practice using github, the app will not be of much interest to anyone outside NZAM. It uses R code to calculate different matrices for a csv file inputted, then weights the matrices accordingly to generate scores.

The second R files (in the folder called brapp) create another app which analyzes aspects of funds, and uses files generated in the previous app as well as the original returns file (chosen by user).

I may upload more shiny apps in the future.
